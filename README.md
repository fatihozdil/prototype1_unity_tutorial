## Overview:
You will choose and position a vehicle for the player to drive and an obstacle for them to hit or avoid. You will also set up a camera for the player to see through, giving them a perfect view of the scene. Throughout this process, you will learn to navigate the Unity Editor and grow comfortable moving around in 3D Space. Lastly, you will customize your own window layout for the Unity Editor.

## Project Outcome:
You will have a vehicle and obstacle positioned on the road and the camera set up perfectly behind the vehicle. You will also have a new custom Unity layout, perfectly optimized for editing.
